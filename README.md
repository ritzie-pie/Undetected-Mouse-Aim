### **Undetected Mouse Movement:**
Today is a good day, today is a great day, Trump is offically back in office. To celebrate I would like to give a gift to the game hacking community. As we enter this opportunity economy and watch the world flourish, remember this, you can add ritzmas on discord for coding services to help your p2c thrive.

Are you concerned about lowering flags for your cheat and staying undetected? Many focus solely on driver detection, but **EAC’s real strength lies in detecting patterns from your aimbot**. 

Here’s the reality: Most legitimate Windows applications use kernel drivers. It’s difficult for EAC to flag your driver as cheating just because it exists, as they’re common in legitimate software. However, EAC has a much easier time spotting cheats based on mouse movement patterns. When EAC detects mouse movement calls originating from the same application across multiple flagged machines, it becomes their easiest and most reliable detection method.

That’s where I come in. I’m releasing a **static library for mouse movement** that addresses these concerns head-on.

### **What Makes It Special?**
1. **Protected Mouse Movement Calls:** 
   - My library uses a highly protected function to obscure mouse movement calls, making it extremely resistant to both static and dynamic analysis.
2. **Polymorphic Mutation:**
   - The library includes a **polymorphic mutator** that scrambles and randomizes your application at runtime. This ensures that even if multiple users run the same cheat, EAC perceives it as a different application on every machine.

By combining these methods, you can drastically reduce flags on your cheat, keeping you undetected longer.

### **How to Use It:**
1. Add `MouseAim.lib` and `capstone64.lib` and `asmjit64.lib` to your project.
2. In your `main()` function, add:
   ```cpp
   if (MouseAim::InitializeMouse())
	std::cout << "Successfully Initialize Mouse" << std::endl;
   else
	std::cout << "Failed to Initialize Mouse" << std::endl;

   if (MouseAim::ExecutePolymorphicMutation())
	std::cout << "Successfully Mutated Application" << std::endl;
   else
	std::cout << "Failed to Mutate Application" << std::endl;
   ```
now you can use `MoveMouse(int x, int y)`
